# Factorial Calculator App

A Python application that calculates and displays factorials using two different methods: the math library and a custom algorithm.

## Description

This application demonstrates factorial calculations by:
- Displaying the mathematical relationship of factorials
- Computing factorials using Python's math library
- Computing factorials using a custom algorithm
- Comparing results from both methods

## Features

- User input for any positive integer
- Visual representation of factorial equation
- Dual calculation methods for verification
- Formatted output display

## How to Use

1. Run the program
2. Enter a positive integer when prompted
3. The program will display:
   - The factorial equation (e.g., 5! = 1*2*3*4*5)
   - Result using math library
   - Result using custom algorithm
   - Confirmation of matching results

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the Factorial Calculator App

What number would you like to compute the factorial of? 5
5! = 1*2*3*4*5

Here is the result from the math library:
The factorial of 5 is 120!

Here is the result from my own algorithm:
The factorial of 5 is 120!

It is shown twice that 5! = 120 (with excitement!)
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- math library (included in Python standard library)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. No additional packages needed
3. Run `python factorial_calculator.py`

## Educational Purpose
This app was created as part of "The Art of Doing" Python course, focusing on:
- For loops
- Math library usage
- Algorithm implementation
- Output formatting
